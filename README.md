# EndlessTower

Endless Tower is a randomly-generated RPG used to explore Java and Object-Oriented Programming. 
It was my final project from my Grade 12 Computer Science class where I applied taught concepts but
also learned others on my own (such as using the swing class and JOptionsPane for a better user interface).

Since the project's origin, it has been expanded upon to include more variety in randomness as well as balance to create
a fun, replayable game.

# Explore The Tower

Endless Tower places four adventurers which the player gets to name (a fighter, a mage, a cleric, and an archer), and has them
explore this tower floor-by-floor.

The player collects items from chests, battles hordes of enemies in classic turn-based fighting style, and levels up
in the shrine by paying gold for new abilities.

They do all this while fighting fearsome bosses every ten levels all to climb as high as they can up the endless tower!

# Object-Oriented

Endless Tower was a project with the idea of delving fully into Object-Oriented Programming. Concepts such as inheritence
and encapsulation are used throughout the code to manage all of the various classes of BattleMembers, Actions, Troops, and more!

Creating an full-fledged RPG was a daunting task, but by managing my time wisely and staying organized, I was able to complete the game.
