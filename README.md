# EndlessTower

Endless Tower is a randomly-generated RPG used to explore Java and Object-Oriented Programming. 
It was my final project from my Grade 12 Computer Science class where I applied taught concepts but
also learned others on my own (such as using the swing class and JOptionsPane for a better user interface).

Since the project's origin, it has been expanded upon to include more variety in randomness as well as balance to create
a fun, replayable game.
