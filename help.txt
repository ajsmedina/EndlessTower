ENDLESS TOWER
By Anton Medina

Endless Tower is a randomly-generated endless RPG.

Name your four explorers  (a fighter, a mage, a cleric, and an archer) and start exploring!
Every character has their own strengths and weaknesses, as well as 3 unqiue subclasses to train.

Navigate the floors by using the on-screen directions. Loot treasure chests for items,
fight enemies for gold, and locate the stairs to move one.

In the menu, you can view party member stats, use healing skills, and use items you've found.

After every 5 floors, you will enter a shrine. Use your gold to level up your characters, improving your
stats and learning new skills. After every other shrine, a boss battle awaits!

In battle, choose to fight (use a skill), guard (reduce damage taken until your next turn), or run away.
You can run away at any time unless it's a boss battle. However, if you run away, you don't get any gold!

Each stat has its own useful effect:
STR: Increase damage of physical skills and normal attacks.
MAG: Increase damage of magical skills and increase max MP.
VIT: Reduce damage taken and increase max MP.
DEX: Reduce damage taken and rank higher on the turn order.

Be careful, because if your party gets wiped out it's game over!
Fight enemies, strengthen your party, and climb as high as you can to explore the Endless Tower.
Good Luck!
